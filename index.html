    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The Web, or World Wide Web (W3), is basically a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files.</P>


  <P>This means you can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots. Not all Internet servers are part of the World Wide Web.</P>
  <P>There are several applications called Web browsers that make it easy to access the World Wide Web; Two of the most popular being Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</P>

  <P>World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet. Learn more in The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web.</P>
