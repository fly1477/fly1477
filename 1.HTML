    <p>Short for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="blank" title="HTML의 설명서">HyperText Markup Language</a>, the authoring language used to
    create documents on the World Wide Web. <strong>HTML</strong> is similar to SGML,
     although it is not a strict subset. <strong>HTML</strong> defines the structure and
      layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.</p>
